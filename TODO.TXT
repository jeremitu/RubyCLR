= RubyCLR Project -- To Do List

Send suggestions for this list to mailto:jlam@iunknown.com.

=== To Do

* Add support for release mode builds in Rakefile
* Add support for release generation (build + .zip file creation) to Rakefile
* Add support for generic interfaces (that works - this is a bug right now)
* Rewrite the method overloading implementation to be more efficient, as well as
  supporting overloading of generic parameter types
* Provide a mechanism to bypass method overloading and assign an alias to a
  specific .NET method based on signature. This will improve runtime
  performance in certain scenarios.
* Implement a stress test that forces garbage collection to run in both
  runtimes, and look for slow memory leaks.
* Revisit inheritance in Ruby shadow classes. Implementation is commented out in
  this drop due to difficulties in handling all scenarios.
